RPE Calculator and Powerlifting management system written in Python.
As president of GW Barbell club, I wanted to automate and store some of the work I end up doing on a daily basis. This project, allows me to keep track of all my lifters as well as update their numbers. Currently working on a feature that will display a month's worth of powerlifting programming with a Lifter's Numbers.
